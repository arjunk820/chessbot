# Chess Bot

This repository is set up to hold code for creating a rudimentary chess
engine.

At the moment, I'm going to set up a turn-based game and then implement minimax
such that the computer can make the best moves.

Future Features to Add:
- Randomize white/black at the beginning of a game
- Difficulty adjustment
